Within the 96-hour competition, our team achieved to build a simulated communication model for recent years as well as the past decades. We built the network model, using several graph theories to figure out how communication style has impacted the world and how it has evolved. Specifically, we considered most of the communication tools including but not limited to phone, internet, newspaper etc.

The title we won, Meritorious Winner, was ranked around 12% among over 10000 COLLEGE teams across the globe. By the time we were given this award, we were still being high school junior students.
